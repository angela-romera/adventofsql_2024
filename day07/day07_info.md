# Santa's Cartesian Elf Skill-Matching Program
Santa's workshop is implementing a new mentoring program! He noticed that some elves excel at certain tasks but could benefit from working with others who share the same skills. To make the workshop more efficient, Santa needs to pair up elves who have the same skills so they can collaborate and learn from each other. However, he wants to make sure each pair is only listed once (no duplicates where Elf1/Elf2 are reversed) and that elves aren't paired with themselves.

## The challenge 🎁
Create a query that returns pairs of elves who share the same primary_skill. The pairs should be comprised of the elf with the most (max) and least (min) years of experience in the primary_skill.

When you have multiple elves with the same years_experience, order the elves by elf_id in ascending order.

**Your query should return:**
* The ID of the first elf with the Max years experience
* The ID of the first elf with the Min years experience
* Their shared skill

**Notes:**
* Each pair should be returned only once.
* Elves can not be paired with themselves, a primary_skill will always have more than 1 elf.
* Order by primary_skill, there should only be one row per primary_skill.
* In case of duplicates order first by elf_1_id, then elf_2_id.

In the inputs below provide one row per primary_skill in the format, with no spaces and comma separation:
max_years_experience_elf_id,min_years_experience_elf_id,shared_skill

Do not use any special characters such as " or ' in your answer.

You can achieve this by setting the following in your psql before running your query.
